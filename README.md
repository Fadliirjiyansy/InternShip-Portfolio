I designed multiple frames to showcase the app's key sections like the homepage, search bar, booking details, and mini games. Additionally, I integrated design elements, including colors, typography, icons, and images, that align with the app's concept and identity. The prototype is also capable of interacting with the user seamlessly, providing a clear and intuitive user flow.
